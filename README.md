# Location Tracking App

A Flutter application that tracks a user's live location and provides summaries of time spent in predefined locations.

## Features

- **Location Tracking**: Monitors the user's location in the background, even when the app is minimized
- **Geofence Management**: Tracks time spent within predefined locations (each defined as a point with a 50m radius)
- **Daily Summaries**: View time spent in each location on a daily basis
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-use UI with "Clock In" and "Clock Out" functionality

## Screens

### Main Screen
- Features "Clock In" and "Clock Out" buttons to start/stop location tracking
- Shows current tracking status

### Summary Screen
- Displays a daily breakdown of time spent in predefined locations and while traveling
- Includes a date picker to view different days
